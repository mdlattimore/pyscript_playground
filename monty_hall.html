    <h2>Monty Hall Problem</h2>
    <p>This is a program that simulates the classic "Monty Hall Problem" based on the classic TV gameshow Let's Make A Deal. In the show's gameplay, the host (Monty Hall) offers the contestant a choice of three doors. Behind each door is a prize. Behind one door is the desirable prize (e.g. a new  car). Behind the other two are worthless prizes (often referred to in this problem as "goats"). When the contestant chooses a door, Monty Hall (knowing where the  car is), opens one of the doors hiding a goat, leaving one door hiding a car, the other another goat. He then gives the contestant the opportunity either to switch their choice to the remaining door not picked, or to remain with their original choice. The question is this: is it better for the contestant to switch their choice or to remain with their original choice? Intuitively, it seems that it doesn't matter -- there are two doors remaining, one hiding a car, the other hiding a goat, making either door equally likely to be hiding the car. However, it is actually in the contestant's best interest to change their guess as they have a 2/3 chance of winning if they do so. For a more detailed explanation as to why switching is the better decision, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a> Wikipedia entry.</p>
        
    <p>This simulator allows you to run multiple simulations and see the results. The program randomly selects a door hiding the car and then randomly selects the contestant's first guess. One of the "goat" doors is eliminated and then the program switches the contestant's first guess to the other remaining door.</p>
